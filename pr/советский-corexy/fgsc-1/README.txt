# Summary

This is a remix of my other designs. I hated having to put 4 screws in the back of the case to hold the face on. Pain in the b***. I was going through Fusion 360 tutorials and found one on how to make a snap together case. I made some prototypes and found it to work very well. Next I made a new design for the ReprapDiscount smart controller (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3071178). Next I decided to remix the first cases I made.

I'm putting them here with all the revisions of base's. 

Made the control knob hole large for a reason. In testing the two controllers I had, I broke off one of them because the model I downloaded had the knob in a different location from the real thing. So that being said, be **VERY CAREFUL** when popping on and off the top cover!!

One more thing. The mount holes very from board to board. If the holes don't line up you may need to drill the board to a little bigger size.

Please let me know how you like this if you use it!! Makes with pictures please! Oh, tips would make the wife understand why I do things like this. Just saying.
